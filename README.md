# ControllerSpecificAssets

**Work in progress. Do not use!**

Controller Specific Assets does what it says on the tin: Only loads your controller assets (e.g. `products.css`, `products.js`) into views rendered by the controller with the matching name (i.e. `products_controller.rb` in this case).

An article on the topic can be found here: [Controller Specific Assets With Rails 4](http://theflyingdeveloper.com/controller-specific-assets-with-rails-4/)
